	   <p>
        Privacy is of utmost importance at the Blockchain group of companies (“Blockchain”).
        We recognize the significance of protecting information which is stored on our computers
        or is intended to be stored on our computers and which relates to an individual. The data we
        protect are the “Personal Data” which is any information relating to an identified or identifiable
        natural person, sometimes called a data subject, and have made protecting privacy and the confidentiality
        of Personal Data a fundamental component of the way we do business. This Privacy Policy informs you of the
        ways we ensure privacy and the confidentiality of Personal Data. We are compliant with applicable privacy laws
        in the countries in which we operate. This policy describes the information we gather, how we may use those Personal
        Data and the circumstances under which we may disclose such information to third parties.
      </p>

      <h4>Use and Disclosure of Personal Data</h4>
      <p>
        Except as part of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Blockchain (in which case you will be given prior
        notice), Blockchain will not use your Personal Data unless we have your consent. We will only use and/or disclose Personal
        Data internally in order to:
      </p>
      <p>Understand and meet your needs and preferences;</p>
      <p>Develop new and enhance existing service and product offerings;</p>
      <p>Manage and develop our business and operations;</p>
      <p>Carry out any purposes for which we have received your consent; and</p>
      <p>Meet legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
      <p>We also reserve the right to use aggregated Personal Data provided that those data do not relate to any individual.</p>
      <p>
        Personal Data may be collected, stored and/or processed by third party service providers or by companies in the Blockchain
        corporate family to perform functions on our behalf. All such third parties will be contractually bound to protect data in
        compliance with our policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except where we are required by law to disclose Personal Data or are exempted from, released from or not subject to any legal
        requirement concerning the disclosure of Personal Data, we will require any person to whom we provide your Personal Data to
        agree to comply with our Privacy Policy in force at that time or requirements substantially similar to such policy. We will
        make reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that they comply with such policy or requirements, however, we will have no
        liability to you if any person fails to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        We shall require any third party, including without limitation any government or enforcement entity, seeking access to data
        we hold to have obtained a Court Order, or proof they are statutorily empowered to access your data and that their request
        is valid and within their power.
      </p>
      <h4>Processing</h4>
      <p>
        We will process your Personal Data legally and fairly and not use it outside the purposes of which we have informed you.
        So far as we are able we shall ensure that all of your Personal Data is accurate and up to date.
      </p>
      <h4>Security of Your Personal Data</h4>
      <p>
        We protect Personal Data with appropriate physical, technological and organizational safeguards and security measures.
        Your Personal Data comes to us via the internet which chooses its own routes and means whereby information is conveyed
        from location to location. As such we cannot give any warranty or assurance that the means where information is conveyed
        to us are safe, reliable or have integrity. We audit our procedures and security measures regularly to ensure they are
        being properly administered and remain effective and appropriate. Our site has security measures in place to protect against the loss,
        misuse and unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. More specifically, our server uses SSL
        (Secure Sockets Layer) security protection by encrypting your Personal Data to prevent individuals from reading these Data as it travels over the Internet. The length of time we retain Personal Data
        outside our back up system varies depending on the purpose for which it was collected and used. This period may extend beyond
        the end of the particular relationship with us but only for so long as we are contractually bound to do so, or so far as is
        necessary for audit or other accounting purposes. When Personal Data are no longer needed we have procedures either to
        destroy, delete, erase or convert it to an anonymous form. We reserve the right to maintain your Personal Data as part of
        our standard back up procedures.
      </p>
      <h4>Storage of personal data</h4>
      <p>
        Data provided to Blockchain is stored in accordance with applicable laws of the jurisdiction of the data subject, at secure
        locations in the EU. Blockchain has ensured that appropriate security standards are in place regarding the safeguarding,
        confidentiality and security of Data. In regard to data subjects resident in the EU, Blockchain, where required, registers
        with appropriate national data protection / information protection authorities. Blockchain also ensures that data is held
        in a manner that meets the requirements of any national law of any member state of the European Union giving effect to
        Directive 95/46/EC. The Directive provides obligations on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
        personal data and on the free movement of such data.
      </p>
      <h4>Withdrawal of Consent</h4>
      <p>
        Except as required or enabled by law (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the laws of the member states of the European
        Union we have mentioned above), we will not use or disclose your Personal Data for any purpose for which you refuse consent
        or later withdraw your consent. If you withdraw consent, you agree that in spite of this withdrawal, we may continue to use
        those Personal Data previously provided to us to the extent that we are contractually or otherwise legally obliged to do so
        and to the extent necessary to enforce any contractual obligation you may have towards Blockchain or in any other way
        permitted by law. You also understand that although you can use our site for some purposes without providing Personal Data,
        we need certain Personal Data, including ongoing relationship with Blockchain or our
        partners. If you refuse to provide us with Personal Data we require or later withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able
        to provide you with certain services.
      </p>
      <h4>Acceptance</h4>
      <p>
        By using this site, you signify your agreement to this Policy. Blockchain reserves the right to change this Policy at any time.
        Any changes will be posted so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what
        circumstances we disclose it.
