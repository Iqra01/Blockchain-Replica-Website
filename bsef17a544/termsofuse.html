      <p>
        8.1. In using our Services, you may view content or utilize services provided by third parties, including links to web pages and services
        of such parties (“Third Party Content”). We do not control, endorse or adopt any Third-Party Content and will have no responsibility for
        Third Party Content including, without limitation, material that may be misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent or otherwise

      </p>
      <h4>9. WALLET </h4>
      <p>
        9.1. You need not use a Blockchain Wallet. If you wish to use the Wallet, you must create a wallet with Blockchain to access the Services
        (“Wallet”). 
      </p>
      
      <h4>10. THE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES</h4>
     
      <p>
        10.1. Wallet Address and Private Key and Backup Phrase. When you create a Wallet, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private
        and public key pair that you may use to send and receive any supported Virtual Currency via the relevant Virtual Currency network. An encrypted
        backup of certain information associated with the Wallet is stored by the Services. The Private Key uniquely matches the Wallet Address and must
        be used in connection with the Wallet Address to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency from that Wallet Address. You are solely responsible
        for maintaining the security of your Private Key and any backup phrase associated with your wallet. You must keep your Wallet Address, backup
        phrase and Private Key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated with the
        Wallet.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        10.2. Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency
        public ledger associated with the relevant Virtual Currency network. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by
        independent third-parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by Blockchain. Virtual Currency networks are operated by decentralized
        networks of independent third parties. Blockchain has no control over any Virtual Currency network and therefore cannot and does not ensure
        that any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the relevant Virtual Currency network. You acknowledge and agree
        that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Virtual Currency network
        used to process the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.3. No Storage or Transmission of Virtual Currency. A Virtual Currency is an intangible, digital asset. They exist only by virtue of the
        ownership record maintained in the underlying Virtual Currency network. The Services do not store, send or receive Virtual Currency. Any
        transfer of title that might occur in any Virtual Currency occurs on the decentralized ledger within the Virtual Currency network and not
        within the Services. We do not guarantee that the Service can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.4. Relationship. Nothing in these Terms is intended to nor shall create any partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy or trusteeship,
        you and Blockchain being with respect to one another independent contractors.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.5. Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept
        and acknowledge that Blockchain is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Virtual Currency transaction
        initiated via the Services, for instance, if you mistype a Wallet Address or otherwise provide incorrect information. We strongly encourage you
        to review your transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.6. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Virtual Currency network via the Services, the
        Services cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. Blockchain has no control over any Virtual Currency
        network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.7. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction
        details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that
        Blockchain is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Virtual Currency transactions or for collecting, reporting,
        withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Virtual Currency transactions.
      </p>
      <h4>11. FEES FOR USING THE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES</h4>
      <p>
        11.1. Blockchain does not currently charge fees for any Services, however we reserve the right to do
        so in future, and in such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any Service to which a fee applies.
      </p>
      <h4>12. MINERS FEES</h4>
      <p>
        12.1. Overview of Virtual Currency Mining. A Virtual Currency network is a network of computers operated by individuals or entities known as
        “miners,” who voluntarily participate in the process of confirming transactions on the network. These computers (known as “mining rigs”)
        compile a list or “block” of pending transactions, verify that each transaction in the block is valid and does not involve an attempt to
        double-spend coins, and attempt to complete a mathematical algorithm that determines whether the block may be added to the public ledger
        of confirmed blocks, called the “blockchain.” Typically, miners receive: (i) an amount of Virtual Currency as a reward for any confirmed
        transaction, generated automatically via the Virtual Currency mining protocol; and (ii) Any fees voluntarily included within the block by
        the individuals who initiated the proposed transactions (“Miners Fees”). Since miners verify Virtual Currency transactions on a voluntary
        basis, it is customary to include a Miners Fee in order to provide an incentive to the miners to add a proposed transaction to the next block
        for confirmation via the Virtual Currency network.
      </p>
      <h4>13. DEFAULT MINERS FEE</h4>
      <p>
        13.1. For Bitcoin, you may choose between three Miners Fee settings: (i) Default, (ii) High and (iii) Custom. For Ethereum, Blockchain will
        determine a default Miners Fee. You accept and acknowledge that Blockchain does not receive any Miners Fees in connection with providing the
        Services, and is not responsible for the speed at which your transactions may be verified by miners.
      </p>
      <h4>14. NO RIGHT TO CANCEL BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES OR MINERS FEES</h4>
      <p>
        14.1. If you use a Service to which a charge applies, or you initiate a transaction with a Miners Fee via the Services, you will not be able
        to change your mind once you have confirmed that you wish to proceed with the Service or transaction.
      </p>
      <h4>15. DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICES</h4>
      <p>
        15.1. We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to you, with or without prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily
        or permanently, any portion of our Services. You are solely responsible for storing, outside of the Services, a backup of any Wallet Address
        and Private Key pair that you maintain in your Wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        15.2. If you do not maintain a backup of your Wallet data outside of the Services, you will be may not be able to access Virtual Currency
        associated with any Wallet Address maintained in your Wallet in the event that we discontinue or deprecate the Services.
      </p>
      <h4>16. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF SERVICES</h4>
      <p>
        16.1. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services in our sole discretion, immediately and without prior notice, and delete or
        deactivate your Wallet and all related information and files in such without cost to you, including, for instance, in the event that you
        breach any term of these Terms. In the event of termination, your access to funds will depend on your access to your backup of your Wallet
        data including your wallet Address and Private Key.
      </p>

      <p>
